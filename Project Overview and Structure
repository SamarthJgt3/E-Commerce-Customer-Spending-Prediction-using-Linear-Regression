🔹 Project Overview

This project implements a Linear Regression Machine Learning model to predict customer yearly spending in an E-commerce platform.
The model analyzes customer behavioral features such as session time, app usage, website usage, and membership duration to estimate the "Yearly Amount Spent".
The goal is to understand which factors influence customer spending and build a predictive regression model.


🔹 Machine Learning Model
Model Used:
Linear Regression (from Scikit-learn)
Workflow:
Load dataset using Pandas
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
Select feature variables (X)
Define target variable (y)
Split dataset into training and testing sets (70/30 split)
Train Linear Regression model
Make predictions
Evaluate model performance


🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed:
Joint plots
Pair plots
Regression plots
Correlation understanding
EDA helped identify:
Strong relationship between Length of Membership and spending
Time on App has more impact than Time on Website

🔹 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Google Colab

🔹 Dataset Information
Dataset Name: Ecommerce Customers Dataset
Total Records: 500
Features Used:
